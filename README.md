# To-Do List Application (Python CLI)

## 📌 Overview
This is a simple **console-based To-Do List Manager** developed using Python.  
It allows users to:

- Add tasks
- View all tasks
- Remove tasks
- Save tasks permanently in a text file

The program uses Python’s built-in `open()` function for reading and writing tasks to a file named **tasks.txt**.
